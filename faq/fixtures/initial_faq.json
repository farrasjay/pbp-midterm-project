            "answer" : "Calories are your body's source of fuel. We need to refuel our energy supply by eating food, yet many diets have branded calories as our enemy for weight, yet calories are a necessary part of our lives. A regular man should aim for around 2500 calories, and a woman around 2,000 calories per day for a healthy diet, unless trying to lose weight. Generally high calorie foods indicate a higher amount of salt, sugars or fat, yet some foods that are naturally high in calories are a useful, nutritious inclusion to a healthy diet. Corn, nuts, avocados, olive oil, and whole grain breads are all calorie-rich but beneficial foods, providing a variety of nutrients needed in your diet and also provide long lasting satisfaction to other healthy foods that fail to fill you up.

            "answer" : "Sugar can be an enemy to a healthy diet, tasting so delicious in a variety of food and even hidden in foods that you wouldn’t suspect. Yet it is important to address the difference between natural and added sugars for a healthy diet. Sugars are carbs which provide a vital source of energy and nutrition, yet many popular foods have sugar added to them, this is when sugars become unhealthy. Fruits and some vegetables contain naturally occurring sugars which are considered healthy when not consumed in overly excessive amounts, but added sugars provide nearly no nutritional value and contribute significantly to weight gain, damaging your health diet. It is therefore important to check the labels to ensure no products contain hidden added sugars. "

            "answer" : "To achieve a healthy diet, vegetables and fruit must be a vital feature to ensure the access to a mixture of vitamins and minerals that are abundant within them. Not only do fruit and veg provide a rich source of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, they also serve as a source of energy, aid weight loss and can be an influential tool in the prevention of disease. Vegetables and fruit can improve the functions of the heart, kidneys, bones and prevent the onset of cancers, diabetes and other diseases. Without the inclusion of fruits and veg, your body will be considerably deficient in vital nutrients needed for all bodily functions from the working of the brain to growing hair and nails. "

            "answer" : "The best time to work out is whenever you can fit it in! Have a look at your schedule and figure out what time of day is best for you. If your routine is flexible, think about when you feel most energetic, or when you would prefer to exercise. Morning workouts can be an energising way to start the day for some, while others prefer working out in the afternoons or evenings.  Consistency is what matters, so focus on working out when it works best for you, which will make it more enjoyable and easier to stick to!"

            "question" : "Can I eat fast food and still put on muscle?",
            "answer" : "Fast food doesn't usually fit the bill as 'clean' food, but you don't have to completely rule it out if you're careful. If you have a fast metabolism, you could eat there daily as long as it's just one of your six meals and you make decent choices. Stick with burgers without the mayonnaise or choose chicken sandwiches that are neither breaded nor fried. Skip the fries. Hell, even two hamburgers from McDonald's provide 25 grams of protein and 66 grams of carbs, which is not a bad combo for a quick fix."

            "question" : "What's so special about protein, and how much of it should I eat? ",
            "answer" : "Protein is the foundation for muscle growth. It directly builds mass by providing amino acids, the essential material muscles use to get bigger. In fact, protein or amino acids are often referred to as the body's 'bricks and mortar.' No surprise, then, that if you want to get big, you need more protein than the average person. Start at 1 gram per pound of bodyweight per day and go up to as much as 1.5 grams. So if you weigh 180 pounds, that's 180-270 grams of protein daily. Be sure to spread that intake evenly over your six meals to maximize absorption and provide a continual flow of building material. "

            "question" : "Is food labeled 'organic' more nutritious?",
            "answer" : "Organic refers to a method of farming, but it's not a health claim. An organic logo does not tell you anything about the calories, fat, salt, sugar or vitamin content of food. A cake made with organic white flour, organic sugar and organic butter is still cake — it’s not suddenly “healthy cake” because the ingredients were grown using organic farming methods. Nutritious foods — whether conventionally or ­organically grown — are those that provide the body with fiber, vitamins, minerals, protein and other key nutrients."
